## Script

You've been working for a web development agency for a few weeks now. After successfully integrating a few websites (HTML/CSS), you are given a new mission.

Your client is Kanap, a sofa brand that sells its products exclusively from its store. Today, she would like to have an e-commerce platform in addition to her physical store to sell her products on the Internet.

</p>

As part of this mission, you work with a team made up of:

- Corinne, the CTO of the agency.
- Frank, the front-end developer who was responsible for integrating the static model of the site.
- Bilal, the back-end developer who implements the API to which the front-end is connected.

## Project informations

This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You
can then run the server with `node server`.
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
